# ROAD-ACCIDENT-ANALYSIS-using-EXCEL
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of reported road accidents from the UK, typically sourced from the UK Department for Transport or other public sources. The dataset includes information on accidents such as date, time, location, weather conditions, types of vehicles involved, and severity levels.

➡️Key steps in the analysis include:

✤Data Import and Cleaning:
Importing the accident dataset into Excel.
Removing duplicates and irrelevant records.
Handling missing values using filtering and conditional formatting.
Converting categorical data (e.g., road types, weather conditions) into meaningful categories using Excel functions.

✤Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Using PivotTables to group and summarize data, such as accident frequency by road type, time of day, and weather conditions.
Creating pivot charts and bar charts to visualize trends like monthly accident rates, regional accident hotspots, and accident severity distribution.
Applying filters to analyze specific subsets of data, such as accidents during rainy weather or in urban areas.

✤Risk Factor Analysis:
Creating conditional formatting rules to highlight high-risk conditions (e.g., accidents during low visibility, high speeds).
Using data filters to analyze specific combinations of risk factors, such as bad weather and road types most associated with severe accidents.

✤Tools & Excel Functions Used:
Data Management: PivotTables, Data Validation, Conditional Formatting, Filters
Analysis & Visualization: PivotCharts, Line Charts, Bar Charts, Scatter Plots, 3D Maps
Formulas: VLOOKUP, IF statements, AVERAGE, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS

✤Outcomes:
This analysis will generate visual reports and data-driven insights into accident patterns. The results can be shared with stakeholders to propose strategies for improving road safety, such as infrastructure changes or policy adjustments targeting high-risk zones.
